ActsAsArchive
=============

**This project is no longer maintained. If you would like to become the new owner, please email [Winton Welsh](mailto:mail@wintoni.us).**

Don't delete your records, move them to a different table.

Like <code>acts\_as\_paranoid</code>, but doesn't mess with your SQL queries.

Install
-------

<pre>
gem install acts_as_archive
</pre>

### Rails 2

#### config/environment.rb

<pre>
config.gem 'acts_as_archive'
</pre>

### Rails 3

#### Gemfile

<pre>
gem 'acts_as_archive'
</pre>

### Sinatra

<pre>
require 'acts_as_archive'

class Application &lt; Sinatra::Base
  include ActsAsArchive::Adapters::Sinatra
end
</pre>

config/acts\_as\_archive.yml
----------------------------

Create <code>config/acts\_as\_archive.yml</code> to define the archive class and archive table for each of your models:

<pre>
Article:
  - class: Article::Archive
    table: archived_articles
</pre>

It is expected that neither the archive class or archive table exist yet. <code>ActsAsArchive</code> will create these automatically.

Override ActiveRecord
----------------
<pre>
class Article &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_archive
end
</pre>

Migrate
-------

Run <code>rake db:migrate</code>. Your archive table is created automatically. (There will be no output -- this is normal)

That's it!
----------

Use <code>destroy</code>, <code>destroy\_all</code>, <code>delete</code>, and <code>delete_all</code> like you normally would.

Records move into the archive table instead of being destroyed.

Automatically archive relationships
-----------------------------------

If your model's relationship has the <code>:dependent</code> option, and the relationship also uses <code>acts\_as\_archive</code>, that relationship will archive automatically.

What if my schema changes?
--------------------------

New migrations are automatically applied to the archive table.

No action is necessary on your part.

Query the archive
-----------------

Use the archive class you specified in the configuration:

<pre>
Article::Archive.first
</pre>

Delete records without archiving
--------------------------------

Use any of the destroy methods, but add a bang (!):

<pre>
Article::Archive.first.destroy!
Article.delete_all!([ "id in (?)", [ 1, 2, 3 ] ])
</pre>

Restore from the archive
------------------------

Use any of the destroy/delete methods on the archived record to move it back to its original table:

<pre>
Article::Archive.first.destroy
Article::Archive.delete_all([ "id in (?)", [ 1, 2, 3 ] ])
</pre>

Any relationships that were automatically archived will be restored as well.

Magic columns
-------------

You will find an extra <code>deleted_at</code> datetime column on the archive table.

You may manually add a <code>restored_at</code> datetime column to the origin table if you wish to store restoration time as well.

Migrate from acts\_as\_paranoid
-------------------------------

Add this line to a migration, or run it via <code>script/console</code>:

<pre>
Article.migrate_from_acts_as_paranoid
</pre>

This copies all records with non-null <code>deleted_at</code> values to the archive.

Running specs
-------------

There is a [wiki entry](https://github.com/winton/acts_as_archive/wiki/Running-Specs) that describes the development setup in-depth.
